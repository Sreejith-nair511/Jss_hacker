<h1>Jss Hackathon </h1> Jss Hacker  

This repository contains multiple webiste deployed in vercel , including **Nova Dash**, **Nova Sim**, and **Thraxa Civilization**. 
Each project represents a unique web-based simulation or game focusing on different aspects of strategy, evolution, and procedural generation and caters to the problem statement we choose  

## üåç Projects  description 

<h2>Novaa: AI-Driven Science Education</h2>

The Problem: Traditional science education relies on textbooks and lectures, limiting hands-on learning due to high costs and lack of research labs.

The Solution: Novaa is an open-source AI-powered simulation platform integrating real-time physics and interactive learning for immersive experimentation.

Key Features:

Nova Dash: AI-assisted Python coding for scientific simulations.

Nova Simulation: Physics-based cosmic exploration.

Thraxa: AI-driven civilization modeling.


Impact: Democratizes science, fosters STEM careers, and advances research.
